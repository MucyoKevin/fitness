      <h2>Nutrition</h2>
      <p>
        This page will highlight a number of considerations that must be made
        and applied in order to bring about substantial changes. In addition, it
        will also serve as a resource and highlight the nutrient-rich foods that
        one should incorporate into their daily gym diet plan.
      </p>

      <h3>Foods To Add To Your Gym Diet Plan</h3>
      <p>
        There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in
        maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and
        composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential
        that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize
        progress accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3>Gym Diet – Pre-Workout Foods</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the
        body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are
        sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact
        on our rate of adaptation. Thus, to prime the body for performance,
        consume complex carbohydrates, for example whole-grains, oats, beans,
        nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Also, be aware not to consume them just
        before the workout as they take time to digest. The recommendation is to
        consume complex carbs one to two hours prior to exercise to allow for
        full digestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, focus on simple carbohydrates in a gym diet plan as they take less
        time to digest and provide the body with energy. It may even be
        recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain
        energy levels and performance. For example, white bread, jam, granola,
        cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a
        pre-workout, energy-boosting snack. While the focus should predominantly
        be on carbohydrates, nevertheless it is also important to consume some
        protein prior to stepping into the gym. So, to support muscle recovery
        and growth, protein levels should be maintained at a high level
        throughout each day.
      </p>
      <h3>Gym Diet – Post-Workout Foods</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote
        muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus
        should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.
        As previously reflected on, the stress of training causes micro tears to
        occur to the muscles that must be repaired. So, consuming protein will
        cause a process known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to occur
        accordingly. It will also begin the repairing process and prevent muscle
        breakdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, there is a widely held belief that protein timing is
        extremely important for maximizing growth. However, a number of recently
        based studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of
        greater importance than the timing. Therefore, High-protein foods such
        as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and
        nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein
        shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting
        protein intake. Carbohydrates should also form part of post-workout
        nutrition as the energy that has been expended during exercise must be
        replaced. Your Gym Diet plan for muscle gain must include the necessary
        nutrients.
      </p>
      <h3>Foods to Avoid in Your Gym Diet Plan</h3>
      <p>
        In the same way that proper nutrition has the potential to optimize
        performance and adaptation, improper nutrition can detrimentally affect
        progress and health. The following three foods should be avoided or
        limited as far as possible. For instance, trans fats are a type of
        dietary fat that has consistently been shown to impact health. While
        trans fats do naturally occur in small quantities, artificial trans fats
        are notoriously hazardous. Artificial trans fats can be found in baked
        goods, fast food, and many snack foods. Similarly, many simple
        carbohydrate foods do not have great nutritional value and contain a
        high amount of sugar. While they may be useful for a short term energy
        boost, consuming a large number of simple carbs can be detrimental.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eating a great quantity of simple carbohydrates will spike blood sugar
        levels initially. However, very quickly, blood sugar levels will
        nosedive and can leave you feeling lethargic which is less than optimal
        for exercise and performance. Although technically not a food, alcohol
        is a substance that should also be limited as far as possible. Since
        there is much research to indicate that alcohol negatively impacts
        recovery and may even interfere with the muscle-building process, it
        might be good to stay away from it. So, it is not great to include it
        when you are detoxifying with your gym diet plan.
