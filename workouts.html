      <h2>Workouts</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym rat, we offer resources and
        tips to help you achieve your fitness goals.
      </p>
      <h3>How long should I workout for?</h3>
      <p>
        Start by setting a goal to continue with the workout programme for three
        months. Creating a long-term exercise routine is all about forming
        positive habits, which means giving your mind and body the time to
        adjust to doing something new. Each workout should take 45 minutes to an
        hour and you should always leave 48 hours between workouts to rest and
        recover properly. A Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine works well for most
        people.
      </p>
      <h3>How much weight should I lift?</h3>
      <p>
        The best thing you can do is start at the lower end of the weight
        spectrum and work your way up until you reach about 60 to 70% of your
        max limit (the most amount of weight you can lift for one repetition
        with good form). That will give you a rough idea of what to start on,
        allowing you to slowly increase the weight little by little every week.
      </p>
      <h3>Tips for each workout</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go slow – focus on your technique</li>
            <li>Rest for 60-90 seconds between each set</li>
            <li>Keep moving when you're resting – a gentle walk around the gym floor will keep your muscles warm and your heart rate up</li>
            <li>Ideally perform the workout in the order listed, but if equipment is busy then switch the order for convenience.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Beginner gym workout for strength</h3>
    <p>The rep range for strength training is 4–6 reps and the idea behind this plan is to exert more energy for less reps (which will mean lifting heavier). If it’s your first time lifting for strength, don’t go too heavy, use a manageable weight for the first few weeks and then increase the load as the weeks go on. Once you think you could lift for 8–10 reps on the same weight, it’s time to increase the weigh</p>
